		<div>Here are three ways to do this.

		<div>A school trip needs at least one adult to every three students. The coach holds a maximum of 27 passengers. What is the maximum number of students that can go on the trip?</div>

		<div>A school trip needs at least one adult to every three children. The coach holds a maximum of 27 passengers. What is the maximum number of children that can go on the trip?</div>
		<div>Using a Picture</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Here’s a plan of the coach, with the driver’s seat at the front.</div>
		<div>To board the coach, you go up the steps at the front and find your seat inside.</div>
		<div>We can get rid of the other details and just focus on the passenger seats.</div>
		<div>There are 11 double seats, and five seats at the back - 27 seats altogether.</div>
		<div>Now fill the coach. Start at the front, with one adult and three children.</div>
		<div>Then add another adult, and another three children.</div>
		<div>Carry on in the same way, until the coach is nearly full.</div>
		<div>There are three seats left. There are already three children for every adult, so we need one more adult.</div>
		<div>Then we can put children in the last two seats. That makes seven adults and 20 children.</div>
		<div>Now fill the coach. Start by adding one adult and three children.</div>
		<div>Using a Diagram</div>
		<div>Here is a diagram with one square to represent each of the 27 seats.</div>
		<div>In this method, we don't worry about making a realistic picture of the coach - it's just the number of seats that matters.</div>
		<div>We can add one adult and three children.</div>
		<div>There are three spaces left. There are already three children for every adult, so we need one more adult.</div>
		<div>Then we can put children in the last two spaces. That makes seven adults and 20 children.</div>
		<div>Using a Diagram
</div>
		<div>Carry on in the same way until the diagram is nearly completed.</div>
		<div>Now add another adult, and another three children.</div>
		<div>Carry on the same way, until the diagram is nearly completed.</div>
		<div>Now there are just three spaces left. We already have three children for every adult, so we need to add another adult.</div>
		<div>Now there are just three spaces left. We already have three children for every adult, so we need to add another adult. Then we can add two more children to complete the diagram.</div>
		<div>The maximum number of children that can go on the trip is 20.</div>
		<div>1 + 3 = </div>
		<div>4</div>
		<div>27 ÷ 4 =</div>
		<div>6 rem 3</div>
		<div>6 × 4 = 24</div>
		<div>Using Numbers
</div>
		<div>Let's see how we can do this without using pictures or diagrams – just numbers.</div>
		<div>The first thing to notice is that we can have a maximum of three children with every adult. So we can try to fill the coach with groups of four (three children and one adult in each group).</div>
		<div>So, how many of these groups of four can we fit on the coach? We need to divide...</div>
		<div>How many fours go into 27?
Six fours make 24, so four into 27 goes six times, with a remainder of three.</div>
		<div>Each group of four includes three children, so that's 6 × 3 = 18 children, and three seats left. Let's think about what we can do with those three seats...</div>
		<div>There are already three children to every adult – so we need to add another adult. We can then put children into the remaining two seats, so the total number of children who can go is
18 + 2 = 20.</div>
