		<div>Here’s a plan of the coach, with the driver’s seat at the front.</div>
		<div>To board the coach, you go up the steps at the front and find your seat inside.</div>
		<div>We can get rid of the other details and just focus on the passenger seats.</div>
		<div>There are 11 double seats, and five seats at the back - 27 seats altogether.</div>
		<div>Now fill the coach. Start at the front, with one adult and three children.</div>
		<div>Then add another adult, and another three children.</div>
		<div>Carry on in the same way, until the coach is nearly full.</div>
		<div>There are three seats left. There are already three children for every adult, so we need one more adult.</div>
		<div>Then we can put children in the last two seats. That makes seven adults and 20 children.</div>
		<div>Now fill the coach. Start by adding one adult and three children.</div>
