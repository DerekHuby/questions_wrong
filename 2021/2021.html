		<div>Calculator</div>
		<div>If you have £995 and you spend £902 of it, how much money do you have left?</div>
		<div>Why did we ask this?</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Numberline</div>
		<div>Here are four ways to do this.

Choose below.
</div>
		<div>Mental</div>
		<div>Written</div>
		<div>Hundreds</div>
		<div>Write the starting number in columns.
</div>
		<div>Tens
</div>
		<div>Write the number we are taking away underneath
</div>
		<div>Start the calculation.
First the ones: 5 – 2 = 3
</div>
		<div>2</div>
		<div>3</div>
		<div>Ones</div>
		<div>0</div>
		<div>9</div>
		<div>Now the tens: 9 – 0 = 9
</div>
		<div>We are working out how much is left after we take some money away.

This is a subtraction (take away) calculation.
</div>
		<div>Home</div>
		<div>5</div>
		<div>In the hundreds column, 9 – 9 = 0 (but we don't need to write this in)
</div>
		<div>></div>
		<div>The answer is 93.
</div>
		<div><</div>
		<div>Write in the subtract sign, and a space for the answer
</div>
		<div>Written Calculation
</div>
		<div>£1000 – £900 = £100
</div>
		<div> £995  – £900 =   £95
</div>
		<div>But you started with £995, not £1000...</div>
		<div>That’s another £2 to take off; so I’m really left with £93.
</div>
		<div> £995  – £902 =   £93
</div>
		<div>Replace the numbers in the question with numbers that are easier to work with.
</div>
		<div>So I’ll be left with £5 less – that’s £95.</div>
		<div>Change the numbers to get the correct answer.
</div>
		<div>Mental Arithmetic
</div>
		<div>And you actually spent £902, not £900...</div>
		<div>If I have £1000 and I spend £900, I will have £100 left.</div>
		<div>In this question we start with £995, and take away £902.

We need to carry out a subtraction:

995 – 902</div>
		<div>Using a Calculator
</div>
		<div>0</div>
		<div>Use a calculator - or your mobile phone
</div>
		<div>Enter the first number: 995
</div>
		<div>Press the subtract (minus) key
</div>
		<div>9</div>
		<div>99</div>
		<div>995</div>
		<div>Enter the second number: 902
</div>
		<div>90</div>
		<div>902</div>
		<div>Press the equals key to get the answer: £93
</div>
		<div>93</div>
		<div>902</div>
		<div>3</div>
		<div>995</div>
		<div>We can use pictures to show the amount of money we start with, and what we take away.
</div>
		<div>?</div>
		<div>We start with £995
</div>
		<div>We need to take away 902
</div>
		<div>How much is left?
</div>
		<div>Zoom in for a closer look...
</div>
		<div>How big is the gap from 902 to 995?

</div>
		<div>A little jump of 3 takes us to 905...</div>
		<div>905</div>
		<div>Another 90 takes us to 995.</div>
		<div>The total gap is 90 + 3 = 93; so we have £93 left.</div>
		<div>Why we asked this...</div>
		<div>This kind of problem is very common – you have a certain amount of money, you spend some of it, and you need to work out how much is left.

This sort of calculation is essential if you want to manage your money!</div>
		<div>The techniques that we will look at will work for any problem that involves subtraction. These problems could include:Working out how much of a journey is left after you have covered a certain distanceUsing meter readings to find out how many units of gas or electricity you have used.Calculating how much more money you need to save to reach a certain target.</div>
		<div>When would I need this?</div>
		<div>Because subtraction is useful in so many different situations, it is worth making the effort to understand how to do it. Take your time, and work through the different methods. You don’t need to use all of them - the important thing is to find a method that works reliably for you.</div>
		<div>You can do this...</div>
