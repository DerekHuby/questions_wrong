		<div>It is important to be able to ‘read’ statistical diagrams like this, so that you can extract the important information and understand what the data is saying.

There are many kinds of statistical diagrams, and it is important to make sense of information presented in different ways.
</div>
		<div>When would I need this?</div>
		<div>Any time you want to make sense of information presented in a diagram; for example:
Interpreting economic information in a newspaper report.Understanding the progress of a flu epidemic.Checking that information has not been presented in a misleading way.

</div>
		<div>You can do this...</div>
		<div>Some statistical diagrams - like the one shown here - are complicated, and can seem confusing at first.Take your time, and work through the data carefully to make sense of what is going on.With practice, you will learn to read the different sorts of diagrams with confidence.</div>
