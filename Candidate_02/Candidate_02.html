		<div>If I have £37 and you have £15, how much do we have in total ?</div>
		<div>Here is the question again; have another go!

		<div>The total is £52. Hit Next to see how we did it.
</div>
		<div>We did this mentally. We split the £15 into £10 and £5.</div>
		<div>First we added on the £10;
£37 + £10 = £47.
</div>
		<div>Then we added on the remaining £5; £47 + £5 = £52.
If you prefer, you could add the £5 in stages; first add £3 to make £50, then add the remaining £2 to make £52.
</div>
		<div>You could also do this as a written calculation.
Notice how we need to carry 1 from the ones column to the tens.
</div>
		<div>Why did we ask this?
Hit Next to find out.
</div>
		<div>We often need to do simple calculations - for example, when working with money.
Building confidence with numbers will help you in lots of situations.
