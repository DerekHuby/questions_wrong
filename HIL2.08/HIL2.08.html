</div>
		<div>To work out the percentage of major accidents, we need to divide the number of major accidents by the total number of accidents, and convert the answer to a percentage.
Hit Next to get started.
</div>
		<div>Start by finding the total number of accidents (major and minor). We can read the values directly from the scale.
The total number of accidents is 10 + 15 + 20 + 4 + 16 + 5 + 5 = 75.
</div>
		<div>Now we need to know the number of major accidents, represented by the dark sections at the top of the bars.
We cannot read off the scale directly now, but it is still fairly simple to find the total: 2 + 3 + 5 + 0 + 6 + 2 + 3 = 21.
</div>
		<div>Now for our calculation. Remember, we need to divide the number of major accidents by the total number of accidents, then convert to a percentage. If you want to do it on a calculator, just key in 21 ÷ 75 × 100 = and you should get the answer 28%.
Hit Next to see how to do it without a calculator.
</div>
		<div>We can simply write a division as a fraction. So in this example we write 21 over 75, and that is the answer as a fraction.
We just need to turn that fraction into a percentage – hit Next to see how we do this.
</div>
		<div>Now we need to change the denominator (the bottom number of the fraction) into 100.
The rule here is that you can multiply or divide the numerator (the top number) and the denominator by the same number, and you will get an equivalent fraction.
</div>
		<div>In this example, there is no simple multiplication that will turn 75 into 100.
It's much easier to start by dividing numerator and denominator by 3, to make 7 over 25.
</div>
		<div>Now it's easy to change the denominator to 100; just multiply by 4.
Do the same thing to the numerator, and we get the equivalent fraction 28 over 100.
</div>
		<div>A fraction with a denominator of 100 is a percentage, so the answer is 28% – the same result that you would get with a calculator.
Why did we ask this? Hit Next to find out.

		<div>This chart shows the accident figures for the following week. How do they compare to the previous one?
Hit Next to see how we can use percentages to compare the data for the two weeks.
</div>
		<div>There were slightly fewer accidents altogether compared to the previous week (down from 80 to 72). So we can say that the overall number of accidents went down by 10% (because 10% of 80 is 8).
But what happened to the percentage of major accidents? Hit Next to continue the calculation.
</div>
		<div>18 of the 72 accidents were major.
Hit Next to continue the calculation.
</div>
		<div>The calculation shows that 25% of the accidents were major (which is less than the 28% the previous week).
So we can say that there was a 10% reduction in the overall number of accidents; and of the accidents that did happen in the second week, a slightly smaller percentage were major.
</div>
		<div>18 ÷ 72 =</div>
		<div>= 25%</div>

		<div>Percentages are a great way to compare sets of data.
Always make sure that you know what you are calculating a percentage of. In the examples we worked through here, we found percentages of the total number of accidents, and it was that total that we divided by when we did our calculations.
