		<div>Biggest Sector</div>
		<div>B. Quarter 2</div>
		<div>The blue line shows the sales for the North region.

North had the highest sales in all four quarters.



Hit Next to continue.</div>
		<div>North is the biggest sector in the pie chart, but that would be true for all four quarters.

We need to use some more information.</div>
		<div>The pie chart shows that South had the second highest sales.



Which quarters is that true for?</div>
		<div>In Quarter 1 and Quarter 3, North had the highest sales, and South was second.



Now look carefully at the pie chart sectors for West and East. Can you use these to decide whether the pie chart is for Quarter 1 or Quarter 3?</div>
		<div>In Quarter 1 the sales for East were much higher than those for West.In Quarter 3, sales for East and West were much closer together.



The figures for Quarter 3 are the best match for the pie chart.</div>
		<div>The pie chart shows the sales figures for Quarter 3.



Why did we ask this? Hit Next to continue.</div>
		<div>Data and statistical diagrams are everywhere.

Television, newspapers and the internet use graphs and charts to illustrate a huge range of articles, including topics like:EconomicsPoliticsHealthEducation</div>
		<div>This question showed you that the same set of data can be represented in different ways.

One of the quarters shown in the line graph was also shown as a pie chart.</div>
		<div>Whenever you see a statistical diagram, it is a good idea to ask yourself:How is the data being represented, and why?Is it a fair representation?What story is the data telling?</div>
