		<div>Show Answer</div>
		<div>I sold two items in an auction. I made a loss of £7 on a vase, and a profit of £19 on a statue. What was my overall profit?</div>
		<div>The answer is 12˚C.

Hit Next to see how we did it.</div>
		<div>Let's start by having a look at a temperature scale.

This scale shows temperatures from 0˚C (where water freezes) to 20˚C (a warm summer day in the UK).</div>
		<div>Our starting temperature is -7˚C; that's 7 degrees below zero. We need to extend our temperature scale to the left.

Notice where we mark our starting temperature - it's a negative temperature, so it goes seven places to the left of zero.</div>
		<div>Now, let's see what happens when the temperature goes up by 19˚C. What was the final temperature?</div>
		<div>The temperature went up by 19˚C altogether. The first 7˚C increase took us to 0˚C.



</div>
		<div>There are another 12 degrees to go (because 7 + 12 = 19). That takes us to 12˚C.</div>
		<div>Why is this important? Negative numbers can be used in lots of situations.

Press Next to see some more examples.</div>
		<div>Here's the first example.

Can you see how negative numbers are useful here?

Hit Next to see how we found the answer.</div>
		<div>I put a pie in the oven 7 minutes before 8 o'clock and took it out 19 minutes later. What time was that?</div>
		<div>There are no 'minus signs' in the question, but we can think of the loss on the vase as -£7.

The first £7 of the profit from the statue gets us back to zero, and the remaining £12 is our overall profit.</div>
		<div>Here's the second example.

Hit Next when you are ready to see how we used negative numbers this time.</div>
		<div>A used car company sold 7 cars and bought 19 more.

How much did their stock change?</div>
		<div>We can think of the start time as 8 o'clock minus seven minutes.

The first 7 minutes of cooking time gets us to 8 o'clock, and the remaining 12 minutes takes us to 8.12.</div>
		<div>A final example. Can you see how negative numbers can be useful here?

Hit Next to see how we did it.</div>
		<div>After selling 7 cars, the change in stock is -7 cars. (The minus sign means the stock has gone down.)

Buying 19 more cars means that the total change in stock is +12 cars.</div>
		<div>You will sometimes see negative numbers in a question; but they are more useful than that.

Negative numbers are often a great way to think about problems involving things that can increase and decrease.</div>
		<div>B. 20</div>
		<div>A. 18</div>
		<div>The temperature at 5 a.m. is –7˚C. At midday it is 19˚C higher. What is the temperature at midday?</div>
		<div>D. 24</div>
		<div>C. 21</div>
