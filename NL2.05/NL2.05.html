		<div>A school trip needs at least one adult to every three students. The bus holds a maximum of 27 passengers. What is the maximum number of students that can go on the trip?</div>
		<div>C.</div>
		<div>Show Answer</div>
		<div>20 students can go on the bus.

Hit Next to see how we did it.</div>
		<div>Remainders</div>
		<div>There are 27 seats on the bus.

How many groups of four (one adult and three students) will fit on the bus?</div>
		<div>We need to divide 27 by four:
27 ÷ 4 = 6 remainder 3.</div>
		<div>Six groups of four leaves three empty seats. We need one more adult, and two students.</div>
		<div>We need seven adults altogether, and 20 students can go on the trip.



</div>
		<div>So the answer was 20; but why did we ask this?

To find out, let's look at some more examples where we need to think carefully about what we do with the remainder.

Hit Next to see the first example.</div>
		<div>A notebook costs £3.

How many notebooks can you buy for £20?</div>
		<div>What would you do with the remainder in this division?



Hit Next to see the answer.</div>
		<div>A rope that is 20 metres long is cut into three equal pieces.

How long is each piece?</div>
		<div>20 ÷ 3 = 6 remainder 2 (or 6.333... on a calculator.)

You cannot buy part of a notebook, so the answer is simply six.

Six notebooks cost £18, and you get £2 change.</div>
		<div>Try this question.



It's the same calculation as last time:
20 ÷ 3. But what will you do with the remainder this time?</div>
		<div>A dog walker is allowed to be in charge of a maximum of three dogs.

What is the minimum number of dog walkers needed to walk 20 dogs at the same time?</div>
		<div>Now the calculator answer 20 ÷&nbsp3 =&nbsp6.333... makes sense.

You should give the answer to an appropriate level of accuracy, so 6.33 metres would be a sensible answer.

</div>
		<div>A final example.

It's still 20 ÷ 3, but how would you handle the reminder now?</div>
		<div>20 ÷ 3 = 6 remainder 2

That meant:6 notebooks6.33 metres7 dog walkers</div>
		<div>Six walkers can look after 18 dogs.

One more dog walker will be needed to look after the two remaining dogs - so seven dog walkers will be needed altogether.</div>
		<div>To sum up:You saw three examples, all with the same calculation: 20 ÷ 3 = 6, with a remainder of 2.That answer was never enough on its ownYou need to ask yourself, 'What does it mean in this situation?'</div>
		<div>Here's the question again.

When you're ready, hit Show Answer.</div>
		<div>B. 20</div>
		<div>A. 18</div>
		<div>D. 24</div>
		<div>C. 21</div>
		<div>Example 1

What is the answer?</div>
		<div>I buy three pens costing £1.99 each.

What is the total price?</div>
		<div>I bought items costing £3.99, £2.98 and £4.99. What is the total cost - roughly?

You do not need an exact answer.</div>
		<div>Rounding is often useful.</div>
		<div>D.</div>
		<div>B.</div>
		<div>C.</div>
		<div>A.</div>
		<div>A dog walker is allowed to be in charge of a maximum of three dogs. What is the minimum number of dog walkers needed to walk 20 dogs at the same time?</div>
