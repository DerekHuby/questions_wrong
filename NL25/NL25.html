		<div>A school trip needs at least one adult to every three students. The bus holds a maximum of 27 passengers. What is the maximum number of students that can go on the trip?</div>

		<div>Question NL25</div>
		<div>Why did we ask this?</div>
		<div>A school trip needs at least one adult to every three students. The bus holds a maximum of 27 passengers. What is the maximum number of students that can go on the trip?
</div>
		<div>6 × 3 =</div>
		<div>6 × 4 = 24</div>
		<div>+ 2</div>
		<div>27 ÷ 4 </div>
		<div>NL25: Solution</div>
		<div>= 6 rem 3</div>
		<div>= 20</div>
		<div>We can use division to solve this problem – but we need to be careful about the details.

Press the green arrow to get started.</div>
		<div>18</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>You can think about filling the bus with groups of four people - with three children and one adult in each group.

It's a division problem, because we can start by working out how many groups of four fit in the bus.</div>
		<div>Four into 27 goes six times, with a remainder of three.

The key to this problem is to work out what to do with the remainder.</div>
		<div>We can put six complete groups of four on the bus - that is 18 children and six adults. The remainder of three tells us that there are three seats left. What can we do with those?</div>
		<div>There are already three children to every adult on the bus, which is as many as we are allowed. We need to add another adult. There are then just two seats left, and we can put children in those.</div>
		<div>So, six groups of four, with three children in each group, makes 18 children.The remaining three seats have one adult and two children, so the total number of children that can go on the trip is 20.</div>

		<div>NL25: About the Maths</div>
		<div>This question is all about what you do with the remainder when dividing.
Here, the remainder means that you finish loading the bus by adding an adult who only has two children to look after. (You can see how this works in the solution.)

		<div>A notebook costs £3. How many notebooks can you buy for £20?
</div>
		<div>Look at the question above, which can be done using division.

What would you do with the remainder in this case?

Have a think about it, then hit the green button to check.</div>
		<div>A rope that is 20 metres long is cut into three equal pieces.

How long is each piece?</div>
		<div>20 ÷ 6 = 6 remainder 2.

If you use a calculator, you will find that £20 ÷ £3 = 6.666...

In this example, you cannot buy a part of a notebook, so the answer is simply six.

</div>
		<div>20 ÷ 6 = 6 remainder 2.

If you use a calculator, you will find that £20 ÷ £3 = 6.666...

In this example, you cannot buy a part of a notebook, so the answer is simply six. The remainder of two represents your change - £20 buys you six notebooks, and you get change of £2.</div>
		<div>Here is another division example. Again, try the question, and think about what you do with the remainder.

		<div>A dog walker is allowed to be in charge of a maximum of three dogs. What is the minimum number of dog walkers needed to walk 20 dogs at the same time?</div>
		<div>In this example, you are doing the same calculation as before (20 ÷ 3), but you don't need to worry about the remainder.

On a calculator, 20 ÷ 3 = 6.666... You should give the answer to an appropriate level of accuracy, so 6.66 metres would be a sensible answer.

		<div>Once again, the calculation is the same (20 ÷ 3).

In this example, six dog walkers will be able to look after 18 dogs. One more dog walker will be needed to look after the two additional dogs - so seven dog walkers will be needed altogether.</div>
