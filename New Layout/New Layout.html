		<div>We can use division to solve this problem – but we need to be careful about the details.

Press the green arrow to get started.</div>
		<div>Try a similar question</div>
		<div>The answer is:</div>
		<div>We need seven adults, and 20 children can go on the trip.</div>
		<div>A school trip needs at least one adult to every three students. The bus holds a maximum of 27 passengers. What is the maximum number of students that can go on the trip?
</div>
		<div>This question was about what you do with the remainder after division.

Let's look at some examples where the remainder is handled in different ways.</div>
		<div>What would you do with the remainder in this division?

Hit Next to see the answer.</div>
		<div>A notebook costs £3. How many notebooks can you buy for £20?
</div>
		<div>20 ÷ 6 = 6 remainder 2 (or 6.333... on a calculator.)

You cannot buy part of a notebook, so the answer is simply six.

Six notebooks cost £18, and you get £2 change.</div>
		<div>A rope that is 20 metres long is cut into three equal pieces.

How long is each piece?</div>
		<div>Try this question.

It's the same calculation as last time:
20 ÷ 3. But what will you do with the remainder this time?</div>
		<div>A dog walker is allowed to be in charge of a maximum of three dogs. What is the minimum number of dog walkers needed to walk 20 dogs at the same time?</div>
		<div>Now the calculator answer 20 ÷&nbsp3 =&nbsp6.333... makes sense.

You should give the answer to an appropriate level of accuracy, so 6.33 metres would be a sensible answer.

</div>
		<div>A final example.

It's still 20 ÷ 6, but how would you handle the reminder now?</div>
		<div>20 ÷ 3 = 6 remainder 2

That meant:6 notebooks6.33 metres7 dog walkers</div>
		<div>Six walkers can look after 18 dogs.

One more dog walker will be needed to look after the two additional dogs - so seven dog walkers will be needed altogether.</div>
		<div>To sum up:You saw three examples, all with the same calculation: 20 ÷ 3 = 6, with a remainder of 2.That answer was never enough on its ownYou need to ask yourself, 'What does it mean in this situation?'</div>

		<div>NL25: Why we ask</div>
		<div>This is a real-world problem where just doing a calculation is not enough - you also need to think about what the answer means.</div>
		<div>SET UP THE CALCULATION</div>
		<div>MAKE SENSE OF THE RESULTS</div>
		<div>Lots of problems are like this - a calculation gives an 'answer' (like 27 ÷ 4 = 6 remainder 3), but we then need to work out what that answer means.

In this example, the remainder means 'add one more adult and two more children'; but in 'More about the Maths' you will see examples where the remainder is handled differently.</div>
		<div>When we solve a real-world problem like this, we turn it into a calculation - we go from the 'real world' of buses and seats to the 'maths world' of numbers and operations.</div>
		<div>We can do our calculations in 'maths world' – but it's important to go back to the 'real world', and decide what the results actually mean.</div>
		<div>This question encourages you to think about what your solution means in the context of the problem. That is important, no matter what problem you are tackling.</div>
		<div>A school trip needs at least one adult to every three students. The bus holds a maximum of 27 passengers. What is the maximum number of students that can go on the trip?
</div>
		<div>NL25: Why did we ask this?</div>
		<div>So this question is really trying to encourage you to think about what your solution means in the context of the problem. That is an important thing to think about, no matter what problem we are tackling.</div>
