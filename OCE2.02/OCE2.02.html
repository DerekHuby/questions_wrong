		<div>A pastry costs 48p.

How much change from £1?</div>
		<div>Can you change the question to a simpler one that you can do in your head?

Hit Next to see how we did it.</div>
		<div>Here's one way of making the question simpler: If you pay for a chocolate bar costing 60p with a £1 coin, you should get 40p change.

Can you use this to find the change when the chocolate costs 64p?</div>
		<div>If you pay for a chocolate bar costing 60p with a £1 coin, you should get 40p change.



Since we actually spent 64p, we get 4p less change - so the correct change is 36p.</div>
		<div>Why did we ask this? Because it's often useful to use rounded numbers to find an answer.

Hit Next to see some examples.</div>
		<div>This example is quite similar to the previous one.

How could you use rounded numbers to find the answer?

Hit Next for the answer.</div>
		<div>I buy three pens costing £1.99 each.

What is the total price?</div>
		<div>If the pastry cost 50p, you would get 50p change.

Since it only cost 48p, you should get 2p more change – so the correct change is 52p.

		<div>Try this example.

Remember to start by rounding the numbers.

Hit Next to see the answer.</div>
		<div>I bought items costing £3.99, £2.98 and £4.99. What is the total cost - roughly?

You do not need an exact answer.</div>
		<div>If the pens cost exactly £2 each instead of £1.99, then three of them would cost £6.

Each pen cost 1p less than £2, so the total cost is 3p less than £6, which is £5.97.

Hit Next for the final example.</div>
		<div>This often happens - we need to know roughly how much something will cost, but we are not interested in an answer to the nearest penny.

Can you use rounded numbers to find an approximate total?</div>
		<div>Rounding is often useful.</div>
		<div>The total is about £12. You can just round each item to the nearest £1, and then
£4 + £3 + £5 = £12.

Rounding does not have to be the first step towards an exact answer - sometimes a rough answer is good enough.</div>
		<div>An estimate with rounded numbers is often a good first step, for example if you are:Checking a bill or planning a budgetCookingPlanning a journeyStarting a piece of DIY</div>
