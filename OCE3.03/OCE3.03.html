		<div>A. £93</div>
		<div>You have saved £902 towards a target of £995. How much more do you need?</div>
		<div>Show Answer</div>
		<div>You have completed 902 miles of a 995 mile journey. How much further to go?</div>
		<div>The answer is £93.

Hit ▶︎ to see how we did it.</div>
		<div>We did this as a written calculation.

We started with £995. Write 995 in columns.</div>
		<div>We need to take away £902.

Write 902 underneath, and a space for the answer.</div>
		<div>Now do the subtraction, starting with the ones (or units) column: 5 - 2 = 3.</div>
		<div>Now the tens column: 9 – 0 = 0.




</div>
		<div>Finally, look at the hundreds column:
9 – 9 = 0.

We don't need to write anything here, and the answer is complete:
995 – 902 = 93.</div>
		<div>You don't need the columns, as long as you line everything up carefully!



Hit ▶︎ to see why this kind of calculation is important.</div>
		<div>This kind of problem is very common – you have a certain amount of money, you spend some of it, and you need to work out how much is left.

This sort of calculation is essential if you want to manage your money!</div>
		<div>Here are some other problems that you could solve with exactly the same calculation.</div>
		<div>You don't have to use a column method for subtraction - you could do it in your head, or use a calculator.

The important thing is to have a method you are confident with.</div>
		<div>None of these</div>
		<div>Now do the subtraction, starting with the ones (or units) column:
5 – 2 = 3.</div>
