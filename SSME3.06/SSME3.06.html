		<div>The compass shows one direction - North.Where are the other compass directions - South, East and West?
Hit Next to see where these go.
</div>
		<div>These are the four main directions - but the question says that the city we are looking for is South-West of London. Can you see where this direction would be marked on the compass?Hit Next to see where this goes.
</div>
		<div>South-West is one of the directions in between the main four directions (North, East, South and West).We have marked the other 'in-between' directions on the compass as well - although we will not need them in this question.
</div>
		<div>If we make a copy of the compass and centre it on London, we can see that the city to the South-West of London is Portsmouth.Why did we ask this question? Hit Next to find out.
</div>
		<div>We have seen how compass directions are important when we are reading a map or giving directions. Compass directions can also be used to describe areas of the country - hit Next to see some examples.</div>
		<div>Here are some examples of parts of the country that are described using compass directions. These descriptions show the rough location of the area within the country – and they are not precise!</div>
