		<div>The train is due to leave at 21.42. What will that time look like on the clock?</div>
		<div>It's after 9 o'clock in the evening - that's 21.00 on the 24 hour clock.

We have marked minutes past 9 o'clock on the clock face.</div>
		<div>21.42 is here. How long until the minute hand gets there?</div>
		<div>The time now is 21.18.



Hit ▶︎ to continue.</div>
		<div>2 minutes later it is 21.20.</div>
		<div>Another 10 minutes takes us to 21.30.</div>
		<div>10 minutes more takes us to 21.40.</div>
		<div>Finally, 2 minutes more takes us to 21.42.</div>
		<div>Look at the number of minutes we added to get from 21.18 to 21.42.




We added 24 minutes altogether, so that is how long we need to wait for the train.</div>
		<div>Why did we ask this?




Hit ▶︎ to see why this sort of calculation is important.</div>
		<div>Even if you use a digital watch or your phone to tell the time, understanding an analogue clock face is still important.

You will often see clocks like this in stations, offices, and public places.</div>
